# Bank-Management-System
--> Overview:
A full-stack web‑based banking application developed using HTML, PHP, MySQL, and Java, the system automates essential banking functions—such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and balance inquiries—while providing both customer-facing and administrative interfaces

--> Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML for page structure, optionally enhanced with CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap for better user interaction and responsive design.
Backend: PHP for handling web logic, server-side authentication, and session management; Java (e.g. through servlets or JSP) for business-logic components or interactive modules where applicable.
Database: MySQL for secure storage and fast retrieval of customer, account, and transaction data with ACID‑compliant operations.

--> Objectives:
> Automate routine banking tasks like account creation, fund transfers, and balance inquiries to reduce human error and improve operational efficiency.
> Improve customer satisfaction with faster, more secure, and convenient access to banking services.
> Provide a scalable architecture that can be extended to include loan processing, reporting dashboards, analytics, digital payments, or integration with CRM systems in the future.
